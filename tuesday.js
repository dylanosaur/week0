/**
 * What is JavaScript? 
 * JS is a loosely-typed, lightweight, interpreted language and is commonly used
 * for manipulating webpages and browser content to create dynamic web pages.
 * 
 * Loosely-typed: Types are associated with values and not with variables.
 * 
 * Some advantages of using JavaScript:
 *  Fast development
 *  Front end dev requires it, can also be used on back end
 *  Don't need complicated dev environment
 *  Lots of community support, lots of open source content
 *  Interpreted languages tend to be quicker to run and test
 *  
 * Disadvantages
 *  Programmer is responsible for managing types
 *  No uniform module package that works cross-platform
 *  Browser code is public and often difficult to understand after being compressed
 *  Interpreted language that may not execute as efficiently as a compiled language
